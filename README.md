#Written Report for assignment
#Draws three conclusions from the data 
1. Funding Goal is equal or higher to 50,000, the campaign is likely to fail the goal.
2. There are a lot of funding raising events in the movie/music industries.
3. The fundraising events in July is more successful than any other months of the year, and ingeneral successful cases are more than failed cases.
#States limitations of the dataset and suggestions for additional tables of graph (10 points)
1. For the category statistics and subcategory statistics, I would suggest to create a chart and table for  the successful rates for each categories, so the audiences are easier to tell which categories are more likely to succeed, instead of showing how many compaign have been failed and succeed are in each categories.
2. It might be good to show the charts that compares the crownfundings in each countries.
